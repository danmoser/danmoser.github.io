Northern Patagonia Trip Info
******************************
Doing the *Carretera Austral*, or *Camino Austral*. This guide was written in early 2016.

.. contents:: Table of contents

General idea & planning
===========================
- Go to Puerto Montt airport (PMC), do the carretera, and flight back from PMC. Problem: price (and time) of the ferries. Must be reserved in advance.
- To save money: rent a car in Santigo and drive SCL until Puerto Montt (~12h). Problem: additional car renting day(s) and 1000 Km do be done. Only for fuel, 140000 CLPs... Not worth it.
- Third option, go to Coyhaique (Balmaceda airport) and do the carretera from there (IMO, best one).
- For sleeping, camping and hostels. Camping from ~3000 CLP and hostel from ~8000 CLP.
- On average, do 250 km/day in the carretera. Stop to do some trekking in previously defined sites.
- To do the full length, 8 days minimum is required (more than 1200 km).
- There is a "circuit option" to Quellón; `Motorcycle Map (15 days) <../figs/patagonia_carreteramapamoto.jpg>`_. Problem: price (and time) of the ferries. In high season, once a week!! Must be reserved in advance.
- From internet: it is possible to do it with a *regular* car (e.g., Toyota Corolla).
- Dates: from 30/01 (D Asmus) until 12/02 (D Moser restriction).

Plan for 8 days from Coyhaique
-------------------------------
- Go north of Coyhaique, where it is more populated ("safer"). At least, reach the **Queulat National Park** in the north. Then we could return and start going south. We should go, at least, till **Cochrane** in the southern direction.
- If we like the northern area, at latest, on Friday evening we start returning. Saturday we would reach the region below Coyhaique and on Sunday we could explore it. We could see Cochrane, sleep north of it (Puerto Bertrand) and then arrive perfecty on time to our flight back on Monday.
- If we return on Thursday, we can go to (Caleta) Tortel. Sleep Cochrane or south of it on Saturday night; Sunday in Tortel area, and at night in north of Cochrane.
- If we decide to do to Villa O'Higgins, then 2 more days are required (return from northern area on Wednesday evening).

Temperatures and Rain (for Feb)
--------------------------------
- Cochrane 19.4 - 8.8 oC. (0.8 historical minimum); 8/28 rains
- Coyhaique 18.9 - 8.9 oC. (0.0 hm); 10/28 rains

Trip costs (approx., per person, CLP)
======================================
- Plane: 80000-200000
- Ferries for a car (minimum)/4 people: 50000x2/4 = 25000
- Car renting+fuel/4 people: (65000+25000)/4 = 22500/day
- Food+hostel+etc: 22500/day

Car rent  
---------------------
- Hertz 4x4, 5 people @ PMC airport, 65000/day (with discount)
- Coyhaique local renters, from 65000 to 100000/day

Airplane costs
----------------
- Buying ~1 month in advance: 120.000
- Buying 15 days in advance: 150.000 
- Santiago (SCL) to Puerto Montt (PMC), Balmaceda (BBA) or Valdivia (ZAL), ~same price.

Destinations
================
**Ventisquero Colgante** and **Capillas de Mármol** (Marble Chapels) must be done.

Puerto Montt - Chaitén
-----------------------
.. The road from Puerto Montt to La Arena is paved the entire way. From La Arena you will have to do a short ferry ride to continue. It departs every hour or so during daylight hours. 700 CLP per pedestrian, 2800 CLP for a cyclist + bicycle, try to find a camioneta to take your bicycle across and save money this way. There is no campsite in La Arena, but you can wild camp on the beach. There are a few places with tasty and cheap empanadas in the village. If you are coming from Puerto Varas and the lake district, you can also take the road through Cochamo and skip this ferry, though the road is hilly an unpaved all the way from Ralún to Caleta Puelche, with a small exception around Puelo. There are nice campsites at Cochamo and Puelo.

.. The road to Hornopirén (close to Rio Negro on the map above) is under construction. As of May 5th, 2015 it's paved until the bridge "Puente Puñon" which is just before kilometer 60. From km 60 to km 70 it is 99% ripio. From km 70 to approx km 74 it is paved, 74-85 is ripio, 85 to approx 3-5km from Hornopiren is paved, and as of May 5, 2014 they were currently working on paving the last bit into town. In Hornopiren you can camp at a campsite for about 3000 CLP or ask a local to camp in their backyard for as low as 1500 CLP (hot shower included). From Hornopirén you will have to take the ferry (once or twice daily in high season) to Caleta Gonzalo. It is in fact a combination of ferry + 10 km road + ferry. The whole thing costs 5000 CLP per person (with or without bicycle), more for cars. Extra passengers in cars (besides the driver) still pay 5000 CLP so it is not possible to hitchhike and get a free ride this way. Drivers will drive the 10 km stretch of road, walking passengers will be taken across by a minivan in order to make the connection to the other ferry that will take you to Caleta Gonzalo. If you are biking, it is best to cycle it (around 40 minutes). Even if you are told that the minivan will take your bicycle across, the minivan driver will not think so. It is a good idea to buy your ticket in advance, once you arrive in Hornopirén, especially if you have a car or bicycle. There is always space for bicycles on the ferries but they restrict the number of bicycles to four on each passage, because of the abovementioned transfer. If there are already four bikes booked on the departure you are interested in, you will be told to find a camioneta that is willing to take your bike across and come back to buy the ticket as a walking passenger. Even if you don't find a camioneta, come back in five minutes and say you did. Then just take your bike on the ferry and bike the 10 km road.

- TBD
- **Caleta Gonzalo**, private park `Pumalín <http://www.parquepumalin.cl>`_. Nice information center. A few hiking trails, including one to the crater of the `volcano Chaitén <http://www.trekchile.com/volcano-chaiten.php>`_. A few campsites.

Chaitén - Coyhaique
---------------------
- **Chaltén** is practically closed since a volcanic eruption in 2008, but the city still works (ferries, gas station, etc).
- (*side trip*) **Amarillo** has the famous hotsprings.
- **Puerto Cárdenas**
- (*in between*) `Ventisquero Yelcho <www.yelcho.cl/es/ventisquero-yelcho/>`_. There is a hiking trail (3-4 hours) to the glacier and a waterfall and a campsite (~3500 CLP).
- **Villa Santa Lucía** has only one cabaña and one little hospidaje (~7500 CLP).
- (*side trip*) **Futaleufu**, famous river (kayaking and rafting) and route to Argentina. Risky: road in bad conditions (April 2014) and no mechanics or tire shops in the way. 
- **La Junta** nice town with friendly people. Hotels from 8000-45000 at Espacio y Tiempo (very nice with great food).
- **Puyuhuapi** town with German influence. Hostel Evelyn (main road, ~150 meters from Copec sign at the bridge; ~6000, including a hot shower, WiFi and a kitchen). Termas de Puyuhuapi appears to be an expensive place (accessed by boat). 
- (*in between*) `Parque Nacional Queulat <http://wikitravel.org/en/Parque_Nacional_Queulat>`_. One can camp at the hanging glacier (6000 CLP + 4000 CLP as a park entrance fee). Then there's the *Queulat pass* at 500 meters. It is crossed by a narrow gravel road with some very steep sections. If you did not camp at the campsite and you need to find a spot to camp around the top of the pass, it is better to camp under a bridge. 
- (*in between*) 5 km north of intersection for Puerto Cisnes (*at the top of the pass*?) there is a nice hiking trail through the *Bosque Encantando*, a very beautiful lagoon surrounded by peaks and many waterfalls. This walk is free! Close to this road intersection wild camp is tolerated. 
- (*side trip*) **Puerto Cisnes**, emergency refuel. Trekking to the `Cascada <http://es.wikiloc.com/wikiloc/view.do?id=4075027>`_, nothing special.
- **Villa Amengual**. A few km north there is a very nice bakery in the middle of nowhere. The grocery store at the plaza has beds and hot water for ~7000 and good food prices. Uninteresting town with mostly expensive accommodation and shops. 
- (*in between*) Reserva Nacional Lago Las Torres, se ubica en el km. 143 de la ruta austral. Esta reserva posee áreas de picnic y camping, y abarca un pequeño lago de gran belleza, flanqueado por los altos picachos de torres.
- **Villa Manihuales** is a small town with many shops.
- (*in between*) About 6 km south from the intersection to Puerto Aysén, there is a boot campsite (Camping Las Torres Del Simpson, 6000 CLP, but worth the money with excellent facilities). 
- (*side trip*) **Puerto Aysén**, **Puerto Chacabuco** (day trip with `Catamaranes del Sur <http://www.catamaranesdelsur.cl>`_ to the San Valentín glacier).

Coyhaique - Cochrane
----------------------
- **Coyhaique** main city of the region. 
- (*in between*) Balmaceda airport. ~50 min to Coyhaique.
- **Villa Cerro Castillo**, going over a pass that is the highest point on the Carretera Austral (1100 masl; important for bikers). At the city, there is a good campsite down close to the river (4000 CLP). It is not the cheapest one but the extra 1000 CLP is worth it for the excellent service. The owner will also give you his self-made map for the trail up to the peak and its lagoon. This way it is possible to go to the peak and back in one day instead of having to camp near the top for a night, as the tourist information office will advise you.
- (*in between*) The road from Villa Cerro Castillo to Puerto Rio Tranquilo is very sparsely populated and in a bad condition. 
- **Puerto Rio Tranquilo** is a very touristy town. The excursion to the underwater caves is very good and not too expensive (5000 CLP; Capillas de Mármol!!!). Access to Parque Nacional Laguna San Rafael (Glacier): the new 77km gravel road goes from Rio Tranquilo to Bahía Exploradores. This makes day trips possible from Río Tranquilo: outfitters provide a necessary boat crossing to continue on from where the road ends. Stay overnight to hear the sighs, splintering and booms of calving ice.
- (*in between*) The road from Puerto Rio Tranquilo to Puerto Bertrand has some amazing views of the lakes (Lake General Carrera).
- (*side trip*) Village of **Puerto Guadal** and area have some accommodation options before going to **Chile Chico** (Reserva Nacional Jeinimeni, 52km southwest of Chile Chico. Turquoise lakes, with cave paintings and flamingos).
- **Puerto Bertrand**
- (*in between*) The last stretch of road to Cochrane is with very difficult up and downhills and with bad gravel. The confluencia of the rivers Baker and Neff is very spectacular.

Cochrane - Villa O'Higgins
----------------------------
- **Cochrane** has a good supermarket with a good selection of food and other goods. There are not many populated places on this road so bring food. Southest **gas station!** 
- (*side trip*) Caleta **Tortel** is an interesting town built on wooden stilts, but is very very touristy, commercial and expensive. One reviewer said it has *some of the most incredible natural scenery on Earth*. Camping is possible at the beach (free) but can be very wet and windy. Accommodation gets full during the day and if you arrive late, you might have to sleep at the shelter at the parking lot. There is free internet in the library and in the municipal building. Cheapest dorm style bed goes for 7000 CLP.
- (*in between*) The ferry from **Puerto Yungay** to **Rio Bravo** is free and goes two or three times a day. It is advised to take the morning or the evening ferry and spend the night at the shelter on either side. The shelter on the Rio Bravo side is much better and is an actual room, protected from the wind.
- (*in between*) From here to Villa O'Higgins the gravel road is generally in a good condition and very pleasant.
- At **Villa O'Higgins** there are some hiking trails. There is free internet in the library and free wifi all over town that sometimes even works. If you are taking the ferry to cross to Argentina, you can wild camp close to the harbour.

O Camino Austral, como é conhecida a Carretera, pode ser divido em quatro trechos:

- **Puerto Montt - Chaitén** - Tem 205 km de extensão e inclui visita ao Parque Nacional Alerce Andino, uma zona montanhosa de 20 mil hectares localizada ainda na Região dos Lagos, e travessias de barco em Caleta Arena e Hornopirén. Outra opção é tomar os ferries que saem de Puerto Montt em direção a Chaitén. Mas a cidade serve apenas de passagem para quem segue ao sul, devido às atividades do vulcão Chaitén desde maio de 2008. O habitantes de Chaitén, o comércio e os órgãos públicos já se preparam para "mudar" a cidade de lugar.

- **Chaitén - Coyhaique** - 406 km separam Chaitén da capital de Aysén, na Patagônia chilena. Os destaques desse trecho são La Junta, povoado localizado no vale do Rio Palena; Puerto Puyuhuapi, vila de origem alemã famosa por suas águas termais de até 40°C; Parque Nacional Queulat e o Ventisquero Colgante, um glacial suspenso; além de Coyhaique, a maior cidade da região.

- **Coyhaique - Cochrane** - Os 334 km seguintes da Carretera Austral oferecem atrativos naturais impressionantes como as cavernas de mármore do lago General Carrera, o segundo maior da América do Sul; e o Glacial Exploradores localizado no Campo de Gelo Norte. Cochrane é a capital de Capitán Prat e oferece serviços de hospedagem e alimentação. Outro destaque é Puerto Bertrand, região conhecida pela prática de rafting e local onde nasce o rio Baker, um dos mais caudalosos do Chile.

- **Cochrane - Villa O'Higgins** - 295 km. O maior destaque desse trecho está em um desvio de 25 km: a curiosa Caleta Tortel. No lugar de ruas, passarelas de cipreste conectam as residências locais com o centro da comunidade. Villa O'Higgins é o último destino desse caminho de 1.240 km de extensão que nasce em Puerto Montt e termina próximo ao Campo de Gelo Sul.
