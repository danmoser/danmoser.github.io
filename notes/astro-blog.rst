Teachers must ditch 'neuromyth' of learning styles, say scientists 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teaching children according to their individual "learning style" does not achieve better results and should be ditched by schools in favour of evidence-based practice, according to leading scientists.

The Mauna Kea land fight

Our place in Space
----------------------
Since the dawn of civilization, we have gazed into the night sky and attempted to make sense of what we saw there, asking questions such as: Where do we come from? What is our place in the universe? And are we alone? As we ask those questions today and new technology expands our horizons further into space, our yearning for their answers only grows. For 26 years, the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has been expanding our cosmic horizons. In capturing an astronomical number of images, Hubble has revealed and shared the beauty, wonder, and complexity of the Universe.

Cylindrical lens
------------------
A cylindrical lens is a lens which focuses light into a line instead of a point, as a spherical lens would. The lens compresses the image in the direction perpendicular to this line, and leaves it unaltered in the direction parallel to it (in the tangent plane).

Identificação de subestruturas no halo galáctico através de estrelas azuis tardias
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defesa em 01 de dezembro. 

Boas estrelas para indicação de metalicidade/idade:

- BHB, Blue Horizontal Branch = gigantes no ramo horizontal
- BSS, Blue Stragglers Stars = estrelas mais quentes que o "contínuo" visto na saída da sequência principal e entrada no ramo das gigantes.

A colisão estelar só é esperada no centro de aglomerados. Fora desta região, a interação deve-se dar por transferência de massa (estruturas tipo disco).

A binaridade das BSS está entre 60%-70%. As BSS não-binárias teriam origem extragalática.

As BSS são estrelas de tipo A, com <log(g)> = 4.3. As BHB, <log(g)> = 3.4. O limite de massa das BSS/BHB é de 2.5 Msun.

Phase Function - light scattering
-----------------------------------
The phase function is the angular distribution of light intensity scattered by a particle at a given wavelength. It is given at an angle :math:`\theta` which is relative to the incident beam. The phase function is the intensity (radiance) at :math:`\theta` relative to the normalized integral of the scattered intensity at all angles. As defined by Seinfeld & Pandis ('Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics'):

.. math::

    P(\theta) = \frac{F(\theta)}{\int_0^\pi F(\theta)\sin\theta\,d\theta}

where :math:`F` is intensity (radiance).

----------

Supernovae and the "RV problem"
-----------------------------------------
There is in the literature the conclusion thate either the dust affecting the luminosities of SNe Ia has a different extinction law (RV = 1.8) than that in the Milky Way (where RV = 3.1), or that there is an additional intrinsic color
term with luminosity for SNe Ia, independent of the decline rate. Understanding and disentangling these effects is critical for minimizing the systematic uncertainties in future SN Ia cosmology studies (see, e.g., `<https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.4524>`_).

Types of astronomical observations with CCDs
---------------------------------------------
- *Imaging*: faithfully (in some way) record of the spatial (angular) distribution of brightness on the sky
- *Astrometry*: faithfully record the relative or absolute positions of sources on the sky (regardless of brightness)
- *Photometry*: faithfully record the relative or absolute brightness of sources on the sky (regardless of position and possibly regardless of how flux is distributed on the sky)
- *Spectroscopy*: faithfully record the relative or absolute flux density as a function of wavelength or frequency
- *Kinematics*: faithfully record the relative or absolute velocities of objects or parts thereof with respect to a suitable standard of rest
- *Polarimetry*: faithfully record (relative) polarizations (degree and linear/circular)
- *Interferometry*: faithfully record (relative) phases or phase distributions of one or more sources
- *Photon timing*: faithfully record (relative) arrival times of photons from one or more sources
- mixtures of any of the above: e.g., *surface photometry*, *spectrophotometry*, *integral field spectroscopy*, etc

For imaging, one has to consider the *plate scale* and *geometric distortions* (the latter particularly for off-axis instruments), but depending on the telescope- and instrument-design, even on-axis instruments may show significant geometric distortions.

For photometry, one has to consider *detection* vs. *measurement* (cf. imaging), *aperture* photometry, *curve of growth* photometry, *PSF fitting*, or *differential* photometry. Calibration onto an absolute flux system (*AB magnitudes*) or relative system (e.g., with respect to Vega).

Rare data from a lost satellite
------------------------------------
The Hitomi astronomical satellite observed gas motions in the Perseus galaxy cluster shortly before losing contact with Earth. Its findings are invaluable to studies of cluster physics and cosmology. 
`Nature link3 <http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v535/n7610/full/535040a.html?WT.feed_name=subjects_astronomy-and-astrophysics>`_

The main result is that the velocities of the gas are quite low, approximately 150 kilometres per second. A notable implication of this is that the additional contribution to the pressure that is associated with turbulence is constrained to be only a few per cent of the thermal pressure (the main component of the total pressure). This means that measurements of cluster mass based on X-ray observations of hot gas, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and neglecting turbulent pressure, will have only small associated errors. This is good news for studies that use the masses as the basis for constraining cosmological parameters4.

However, these measurements were made for only one cluster and only in the cluster's central region, and are therefore not necessarily applicable to clusters in general.

Challenges in magnetic studies of Herbig Ae/Be stars
------------------------------------------------------
Swetlana HUBRIG (Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics, Potsdam)

    Magnetic fields are of fundamental importance for the intermediate-mass star formation and accretion-ejection processes.
    Models of magnetically driven accretion and outflows successfully reproduce many observational properties of the classical T Tauri stars, but the picture is less clear for higher-mass stars, the Herbig Ae/Be stars, due to the poor knowledge of their magnetic field topology. So far, the magnetic field geometry is constrained only for two Herbig Ae/Be stars, and only about 20 Herbig stars were reported to host magnetic fields. Studies of the magnetic field topology using spectropolarimetry are extremely important because they enable us to improve our insight into how the magnetic fields in these stars are generated and how they interact with their environment, including the impact on the planet formation processes and the planet-disk interactions. In this talk, I will present the status of the spectropolarimetric studies of Herbig Ae/Be stars carried out during 
    the last years.

Exploring Markdown
--------------------
Markdown is the official syntax of IPython Notebook, and also appears on Slack. It main advantage to reST is when writing LaTeX inputs: ``$\alpha$`` and ``$$f(x) = x$$`` are valid entries. 

However the built-in Sublime render is not able to solve Latex. Then I needed to install ``pandoc``:

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install pandoc

Then you can create HTML with the command:

.. code:: bash

    pandoc test.md -f markdown -t html -s -o test.html
    # To include support to equations:
    pandoc test.md -f markdown -t html -s -o test.html --mathjax=https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML -H header

Where the ``header`` file has the following content:

.. code:: html

    <script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
        MathJax.Hub.Config({ TeX: { equationNumbers: {autoNumber: "all"} } });

The ways of detecting an exoplanet **atmosphere**
------------------------------------------------------
Basically, only three methods:

- *Coronagraphy*: blocks the stellar surface, and the the exoplanet appears from the reflected light. Only 4 or 5 possible targets nowadays (2010s).
- *Spectral subtraction*: just before an exoplanet being occulted (i.e., the planet is about of passing behind the star for the observer) a significant fraction of the stellar flux is reflected, and it can be observed by the subtraction of the spectrum opposite to the occultation.
- *Transit*: during the transit, the presence of the exoplanet changes the **colors** of the stellar flux, mainly in the IR. These changes reveal the molecular properties of the exoplanet atm.

Beta Pictoris moving group
----------------------------
It is a young moving group of stars located relatively near Earth. A moving group, in astronomy, is a group of stars that share a common motion through space as well as a common origin. This moving group is named for `Beta Pictoris <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Pictoris>`_.

The Beta Pictoris Moving Group is an important object for astronomical study as it is the closest youthful group of stars to the Earth. The group covers a region of space for the most part visible only in the Southern Hemisphere.

Discovery
^^^^^^^^^^
An early estimated age for the star Beta Pictoris at about 10 million years proved problematic due to the star's apparent isolation in space. According to current theory regarding stellar evolution, extremely young stars of this age should be located near other young stars that formed from the same region in space. It is not until significantly later that gravitational interactions with other stars causes stellar 'siblings' to disperse.

In 1999 the situation was resolved by the discovery of a pair of dim red dwarf stars that were found to have a similar velocity and age to β Pictoris, lending credence to the estimated age of the star.

Further work published in 2001 identified a total of 17 stellar systems with a similar motion and age as the Beta Pictoris moving group, named for the primary member of the association.

File compression with ``bz2``
-----------------------------------
``bz2`` compression library is natively supported by Python (see `the Standard Library docs <https://docs.python.org/2/library/bz2.html>`_). The compression rate is about as ``gunzip``, although the compression is quite faster.

.. warning::

    There is a parallel version of ``bz2`` which is **not** compatible with the native one in Python 2 (`pbzip2 <http://compression.ca/pbzip2/>`_). In Ubuntu, it can be installed with the command ``apt-get install pbzip2`` and on Python with ``pip install bz2file``. Although using the same algorithm to compression, Python 2 **can not read** these files (my tests with Python 3.4 also did not succeed).

From `the Standard Library docs <https://docs.python.org/2/library/bz2.html>`_:

.. note::

    This class does not support input files containing multiple streams (such as those produced by the ``pbzip2`` tool). When reading such an input file, only the first stream will be accessible. If you require support for multi-stream files, consider using the third-party ``bz2file`` module (available from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bz2file>`_). This module provides a backport of Python 3.3's ``BZ2File`` class, which does support multi-stream files.

Compactação de arquivos, imagens e FITS
-------------------------------------------
Existe dois tipos de compactação para arquivos:

- Lossless Compression (zip e cia.); e
- Lossy Compression (jpg e cia.).

O `fpack <https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fpack/>`_ é específico para o formato FITS e, por padrão, trabalha com a compactação Lossy, desenvolvido especificamente para ignorar o ruído das imagens e manter a informação de ciência. Ele oferece suporte para a compactação Loseless.

É importante saber que a compressão Lossless tem por fundamento evitar redundâncias nos dados - e por isso não há perdas. Também pode-se, com o Python por exemplo, ler um arquivo ``*.zip``, ``*.bz2`` ou ``*.gz`` diretamente para a memória sem de fato descompactar-lo - isto é, grava-lo no disco - o que torna o processo muito rápido.

Os processos Lossy de um lado perdem uma pequena parte da informação. De outro lado, eles ocupam ainda menos espaço em disco - e podem alimentar a memória de uma maneira muito rápida também.

Se alguém souber do algoritmo Lossy do fpack, eu sou todo ouvidos. Outro algoritmo eficiente para a compactação Lossy de imagens é o "kernel-PCA" - mas que ainda não está implementado num programa de fácil acesso (até onde eu sei).

Rotational rates of Be stars... again
----------------------------------------
The :math:`v\sin(i)` measurement in hot stars is not easy... Some issues for the case of the Be stars:

- There is no photospheric "good line" that can used in the entire B-type spectral range (i.e., working equally good for the B late-types and the B early-types). All the lines present in this spectral range can be *contaminated* by circumstellar (CS) emission features or are *sensible to the rotational effects*.
- What is said for the lines is true for the different methods (EW, FWHM, etc): works fine for some cases, not for others... With that said, there is no big fundamental changes if the method consider - or not - the rotational effects.
- Hydrogen lines are never used to the determination of the :math:`v\sin(i)`.
- Because of the nature of the CS emission:
    
    - The lines are not equally affected. Owing to the emission, some lines will appear narrower than others.
    - With CS emission, **in most cases** the lines will appear narrower that they should be, creating a **systematic underestimation** of the :math:`v\sin(i)` value.
    - **BUT** this depends on the line analyzed, the inclination angle, and the spectral type of the star... In specific cases, the value can be *overestimated*.
    - In general, the methods work fine for low *i*, and increase their underestimation as *i* increases.
    - Rule of thumb: :math:`v\sin(i)` should be used as a **lower limit** value.

- There is a revision on the methodology of measurements of :math:`v\sin(i)` starting in 1975 (and took a while to be used). So, values older than from 1985 should be used with caution (or even don't be used at all). The main difference is that the older values have **overestimated** values when compared to the newer values.
- The main reference for the method of Fremat+ (2005) is Chauville (2001).
- Beyond the systematics of the **method**, the rotational effects tends to **underestimate** the :math:`v\sin(i)` (e.g., Townsend 2004)...
- As seen in Achernar (Rivinius+ 2013), the Be stars do show an intrinsic :math:`\Delta v`, related to the CS activity (:math:`\sim +0.1v\sin(i)`).
- CONCLUSION: the real :math:`v\sin(i)` (:math:`== v_{rot}` in i.e., BeAtlas) can be much higher than the measured (or "observational") one.

Rotation in massive stars
---------------------------
by Oscar Ramírez (United Kingdom Astronomy Technology Centre)

    Rotation is a key parameter in the evolution of massive stars (masses larger than 10 solar masses), affecting the evolution, chemical yields, ionizing photon budget, and the final fate as supernovae and long-duration gamma-ray burst. We determine the (projected) rotational velocity for more than 330 O-type stars in 30 Doradus, a starburst region in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It contains the richest population of massive stars in the Local Group and is the best possible laboratory to investigate open questions on the formation and evolution of massive stars. Among our sample stars, we have identified 116 spectroscopic binary systems and 216 presumably single O-type stars. The most distinctive feature of the (projected) rotational velocity distribution of the single star sample is a two-component structure; i.e a low-velocity peak (at ~ 80 km/s) and a high-velocity tail extending up to 600 km/s. We argue that the low-velocity peak is the outcome of formation. The presence of a well populated high-velocity tail is compatible with population synthesis computations that study the effects of binary evolution, i.e. tides and mass transfer (de Mink et al. 2013) and that produces a population of merged objects, and post-mass-transfer binaries that appear as single objects. The distribution of stars in binary systems also presents a low-velocity peak at around the same velocity, as the single sample, however there is no tail of rapidly spinning stars (> 400 km/s). This also concords with binary evolution effects.

How to reduce VLTI-PIONIER data
--------------------------------
This is not *required*, since the PIONIER deliver the data already reduced.

If details/enhanced precision is needed, the reduction is in two steps: https://forge.osug.fr/svn/ipag-sw/PIONIER/trunk/doc/PNR-MAN-PNDRS.pdf , see Sects. 6 and 7.

Only the second, the calibration, should be tweaked. In this particular case: make sure the interpolation of the transfer function is over all calibrators, and possibly chose s different interpolation law. Also, some files have the fits keyword DET.SAT set to "T", try also to reduce the data without these files.

First, just install the software and get the data to play with. The output is very verbose, a lot of things to look at.

Cranmer (2005)
----------------
It is a statistical study of the equatorial rotational rates of Be stars. It was found a trend related to the :math:`\bar{v}/V_{crit}` with the spectral time: earlier is the spectral type (Sp), lower is :math:`\bar{v}/V_{crit}` (but all should have members with *Veq=Vcrit*).

Definition: :math:`v\sin(i)` is the empirical (i.e., apparent) value, while :math:`V_{eq}\sin(i)` is the one with known parameter values. Realize the distinction: 

- (i) :math:`v\sin(i)` is the observation (in principle, convolved); 
- (ii) :math:`V_{eq}\sin(i)` is the intrinsic values (not apparent);
- (iii) Exists still :math:`v\sin(i)_{model}` from (ii) into (i). This value is not unique: a different combination of :math:`V_{eq}\sin(i)` leads to the same :math:`v\sin(i)`.

Conclusion from Townsend (2004): GB and OB must be taken into account, otherwise the derived *Veq* will be maximum at ~0.8. Importance of determining *Veq* is to constrain the mass-loss mechanism. 

The work treats separately the Sps and try to recover the *Veq/Vcrit* distribution of each of them, taking into account the OB+GD. "The actual rotation speeds may be even lower if GD is overestimated" (generalization of Townsend's idea).

From Yudin (2001) Sp and Lclass => Teff and Lum from de Jager (1987) => M* from Claret (2004). The derived *Vcrit* are 20% higher than Chauville (2001). Both values were kept to the analysis. Subsamples divided in five groups, from Very-Early to Very-Late types: [VE, E, M, L, VL]. :math:`v\sin(i)/V_{crit}` have a systematic dependence on Teff, but not :math:`\sigma`.

For a given *Veq* (i.e., M*, Sp, etc.) and *i*, a unique line profile is generated. The contrary (i.e., unique profile leads to unique *Veq*) is not true. 

The line profile (:math:`R_\nu`) is calculated by :math:`\int I_{\nu,L}/\int I_{\nu,C}`. *In short*, the line is calculated by a Voigt profile with a thermal broadening and limb-darkening (LB), and the continuum by a Black Body function and (the same) LB coefficient. 

The effects of the rotation in the line profile as assessed by the FWHM measurements: :math:`D=FWHM_{Veq}/FWHM_0`, that allows to determine a :math:`\delta V`, that can used to determine:

.. math::

    \left( \frac{V\sin(i)}{V_{crit}} \right)_{measured} \propto D\sin(i) \left( \frac{V_{eq}}{V_{crit}} \right)

Typically, the errors of :math:`v\sin(i)\sim 10\%` and :math:`v\sin(i)/V_{crit}\sim 30\%`. They were estimated (see below).

To ensure that all Be star *are not* rotating critically (i.e., maximized the derived *Veq*) it is assumed: B9 corrections for :math:`v\sin(i)` to all Sps, and no GB+OB corrections in the measurements of Yudin.

COMMENT: I believe the effects of GD are more extreme in B9 is the relative importance (i.e., contrast) of the flux redistribution (to be checked).

In other contour the ambiguity of the statistical distribution of the rotation rates (:math:`v\sin(i)` is not unique), a Monte-Carlo *forward method* was used to explore the parameters, with the "likelihood" of the models determined by a :math:`\chi^2` based on the number at each bin of *Veq*.

So the incidence of the rotation rates is done by a "trapezoidal" function :math:`\psi(V_{eq})` with 4 parameters, 3 free because one is set by normalization (the function is dependent of *Vmin*, *Vmax*, *b* and *m*; the later two are equivalent to the S and its normalization).

To sample :math:`\psi(V_{eq})`, it is created 80 :math:`\psi_i(V_{eq})=\delta(V_{eq}-V_i)`, so *Veq* is sampled (by MC) will all combination of parameters (i.e., *i* and the observational error :math:`\zeta`).

With this, and applying all methods discussed the bins of the histogram :math:`\phi(v\sin(i))` is created, with weights determined by :math:`\phi(V_{eq})`.
 
The first analysis is to see the expected behavior if all stars were rotating critically (remember, the histograms are of :math:`v\sin(i)` and **not** of :math:`V_{eq}\sin(i)`). So the maximum value was :math:`v\sin(i)/V_{crit}\sim0.68`. Although all efforts were made to agree the observed and the simulated distributions (in terms of hypothesis choices), it was impossible to reproduce the observations. This was taken as an evidence that not all stars are rotating critically.

So the following analysis were done under more realistic assumptions (i.e., not only Chauville *Vcrit*, and proper corrections beyond B9 = proper *D* values).

The influence of the observational errors were studied comparing the quality of the :math:`\chi^2`, and confirmed that they are about 10-20% (in :math:`v\sin(i)` - by the spread of the distributions). COMMENT: we should believe here the author, because I believe than it is intrinsically indistinguishable from a spread in the *Veqs*.

The derived best-fits puts :math:`\bar{V_{eq}})/V_{crit}=0.684-0.854`, and there is a definite dependence of *Vmin* on spectral type. The derived *Vmax* do not change (~0.85 to standard values and ~1.0 to Chauville) and shape of :math:`\psi(V_{eq})` depend rather strongly on the uncertainties. 

Better than determining :math:`\psi(V_{eq})`, it to determine the *Vmin-Vmax* range. While *Vmax* is compatible with 1.0, *Vmin* follows a dependence with the spectral type. Important point: if the gravity darkening effects were overestimated, then *Vmin* values may be lower. 

To understand...
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Statistics: *kurtosis* measures the relative importance between the tails to the peak of the distribution; *skewness* measures the symmetry of the distribution. 

- "The fact that are no stars with measured :math:`v\sin(i)>V_{crit}` tends to the conclusion that Be stars are not all rotating critically". == Depends on GD and observational errors!

- Why the distributions have "no zero tail"? Because of :math:`\cos^{-1}(\mu)`. 

- Why use the :math:`\cos^{-1}(\mu)` angle distribution instead a uniform one for *i*? Because we are interested on the **projection** of the angles, not their (uniform) distribution (as when a spherical area is uniformly described for a given reference direction). 

Investigation of GD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
From literature: cooler stars, :math:`\beta \leq 0.1` (convection). :math:`\beta \geq 0.25` from lightcurves of the hot eclipsing binaries. 

The author generalize the idea of Townsend (2004), and shows how stronger GD effects would change the :math:`v\sin i` distribution. Two things to note: the author use GD but it may mean "GD+OB". Second, he says that :math:`\beta=0.25` is the best fit with :math:`\sigma=0.15`, but he fitted :math:`\sigma=0.15` for :math:`\beta=0.25`!!! 


Fundamental stellar parameters + *Veq* = polarization models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
The first idea is that dense CS disks only occur when *Veq > Vmin*. The triangular shape from Yudin (2001) is hard to explain by standard scattering models. The idea is to use the derived distributions of *Veq/Vcrit* to simulate the polarization values. 

The results are highlighted as *only a general consistency test*. 

Use the model of McDavid (2001): (i) sin(*i*) distributions; (ii) Spectral types from Yudin, specified by the non-rotating value of *Teff* and sampled according to the frequency in the database; (iii) *Vmin* (fitted) to *Vmax = Vcrit* is flat; (iv) all stars are in the main sequence; (v) *Tdisk = 0.75*Teq*; (vi) empirical law to :math:`\rho = \rho_0(R/r)^{-3.1} \propto T_{eff}^{2.2}` (empirical).

There are two limiting densities: (i) the photospheric one, using tabulated values of :math:`\kappa_R` (Rosseland's average) and *H* (scale height) from log(*g*), where :math:`\tau_R\approx\kappa_R\rho H=1`. (ii) :math:`\rho` as the sonic point density, once :math:`\dot{M}=\rho4\pi c_s R^2` (where R is the radius at which the radial flow speed equals the sound speed). :math:`\dot{M}` for a wind, from Vink+ (2000). *R = Req*, but for viscous disks is much larger, thus the base of the disk is most likely highly subsonic). 

Opening angle from "the basic theory of Keplerian accretion disks", :math:`\alpha = f\tan^{-1}(c_s/V_{Kep})`, resulting in :math:`3^\circ-10^\circ`. The same of the results do no depend on *f* value. The polarization from an axisymmetric disk is proportional to :math:`\sin\alpha\cos^2\alpha`. More accurate relation that takes account of stellar occultation by a thin disk (Fox & Brown, 1991). 

Left of triangle = :math:`\sin^2(i)` dependence. Right = not so easy to understand. The explanations from Yudin: (i) depolarization from **GD** (exactly happening with *Veq = Vcrit* stars), (ii) lower intrinsic polarization for disks around the later type stars (that also have the highest values of *Veq*) and (iii) disk opening angle inversely proportional to *Veq*. All of them were not thought to be strong enough to produce the observed decreases, and the author claim the reduction of *Teff* to explain the decrease.

WTF "The mass loss from the disk may come to dominate the angular momentum transport, and lower densities may occur because of greater leakage to an equatorial wind"?

"More work needs to be done to compare the derived disk properties of stars with similar Sp but different roation rates".

Conclusions
^^^^^^^^^^^^
"Rotational color effects": *GD* more pronounced in the UV. Critical rotation is unlikely for all Be stars because of the large predicted photospheric shift **above** the main sequence. 

"Measuring the widths of lines that are formed in the narrow 'boundary layer' above the subcritical photosphere, but below the inner edge of the Keplerian disk may be a crucial probe of the physical origin of the Be phenomenon".

Hubble Catches Views of a Jet Rotating with Comet 252P/LINEAR

Histograms, centroids and areas
---------------------------------
In an histogram, by definition, :math:`N=\sum_i N_i=(\int n(x) dx)/(\int dx)`. One can also have the area of histogram with :math:`A=\sum_i N_i \Delta x_i=\int n(x) dx`. The formula to calculate the barycenter (or centroid) is

.. math::

    \bar{x} = \frac{\int x n(x) dx}{\int n(x) dx}=\frac{\sum_i N_i x_i \Delta x_i}{A}

These are the magic relations between these quantities. 

One (bad) example: **if** :math:`t=x` and :math:`v(t)=n(x)`, then :math:`\Delta S=\sum_i v_i \Delta t_i=\int v(t) dt`. **But** :math:`v(t)=n(x)` would lose the sense of "counting" a quantity, and would acquire the sense of describing its intensity.

------

Definitions of *i* and PA in astronomy
----------------------------------------
In principle, :math:`-\pi/2 \leq i \leq \pi/2`, but it is often seen as :math:`0 \leq i \leq \pi/2`. With the drawings below (and supported by the work of Roettenbacher+ 2016) I show that :math:`-\pi/2 \leq i \leq \pi/2` is do required and that :math:`i=0` corresponds to the rotational axis pointed to the observers direction (assuming the "right-hand rule" for the 3D rotation.)

.. figure:: ../figs/astro-blog_PAi.png
     :width: 640

     Conclusion of the drawing: :math:`0 \leq i \leq \pi/2` is inconsistent with the "right-hand" rule.

It is possible to see that the same values of (PA, *i*) give different images (or, in other words, for a given image, the choice of PA and *i* leads to different rotation).

My conclusion: :math:`|i|` is taken when analyzing quantities that do not consider the *sense of the rotation* (e.g., imaging or :math:`v\sin(i)` measurements). Otherwise, it *must* be taken into account. 

FITS images standards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
FITS images are constructed from left to right and **south to north** (that means that the first line is the bottom of the image, and not the opposite). This also means that, by standard, **the east will be in the right direction**, contrary to most of the sky images we see. 

To compensate this, there are two options: mirror the image or add a negative value for the header variable CDELT1 (i.e., *x* coordinate). The same can be done if your image in "top-bottom" (instead of bottom-top).

    Distributions using *i* values from above (and not :math:`\cos^{-1}(\mu)`)


Chandrasekhar (1950): "The probability of occurrence of the inclination angle *i* between *i* and *i+di* is known to be :math:`\sin(i)`". Note that this idea is "compatible" with the following one: image that you have a projected dimension uniformly distributed from 0 to :math:`S_{max}`. What are the intrinsic angles? Answer: the :math:`\cos^{-1}(\mu)` distribution!

Better statement: a quantity that is a perpendicular product to the line of sight and that is randomly distributed will be observed with a probability distribution of :math:`\sin(i)`" (for a parallel product, it will be a :math:`\cos(i)`").

Analogy: a ship traveling perpendicular to the stellar equator at a constant speed. It would quickly cross the equator, but it would take very long to cross the poles; position == :math:`\sin` distribution of the latitude (unless it is seen edge-on)! But most of the time, the a "random" ship would be seen close to the meridian, because the longitude in this case would follow a :math:`\cos` distribution.

:math:`\bar\sin(|i|)` = 0.636, which corresponds to :math:`i` = 39.5 deg.

Given :math:`y=x\sin(i)`, Chandrasekhar do a "bodybuilder" and takes from his hat that :math:`\bar y =  \bar x 4/\pi`. What I found is that is exactly :math:`\bar{y \sin(i)} = \bar{ x \left( \sin (i) \right)^2 }`. This is confirmed using Slettenbah (1949) :math:`v\sin(i)` values.


Porter 1996
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Things to understand better in the article:

- Is the low number os :math:`w\sin(i) < 0.125` significant, or it is a bias?

- How he estimated 5 deg. as characteristic opening angle?

.. math::

    \arcsin \left( \frac{14}{163} \right)*180/\pi = \sim 5.0

Scenario
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let's suppose we have for each spectral type a **constant number of Be stars** from *W100* to *Wmax = 1* (in each sub-interval *dW*). What is the :math:`\bar{W}`?

.. math:: 

    \bar{W} = \frac{Wmax-W100}{2}
    
Rivinius+ (2013) affirms that :math:`\bar{W}` and :math:`W100\sim0.7` do not depend on the spectral type. So, by the above formula :math:`\bar{W}\simeq0.85` (the observed value is :math:`\bar{W}=0.80`).

However, the efficiency to transfer a B-normal star into a Be star *does* depends on the spectral type. Let's suppose a **constant number of B-type stars** for a given rotational rate and the following "efficiency" curve to become a Be star:

.. figure:: ../figs/astro-blog_vcrit2.png
    :width: 640

where *Wmin* and *W100* have arbitrary values. Using the values from Rivinius+ (2013; i.e., :math:`\bar{W}=0.8`, *W100* = 0.64 to early-type Be stars and *W100* = 0.95 to late-type), which are the values of *Wmin* for them?

*Wmin* = 0.56 for the early-type and *Wmin* = 0.40 for the late ones. Since early-type stars are very efficient to produce the phenomenon, the late-type ones need to have members of lower rotational rates (:math:`W\sim0.4`) in other to keep the same :math:`\bar{W}`.

If the efficiency curve (plus :math:`\bar{W}` and *W100*) are right, the *Wmin* values could be increased if the number of critical rotators are increased for a given spectral type (i.e., change the number of B-type stars as function of the rotational rate).

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~~
For a given spectral type, the number of Be stars at a given rotational rate *W* is the product of the number of B-type stars rotating at that level times the efficiency to the star become a Be star (assuming no change in *W* before and after the Be phenomenon).

Scientists may have to wait for the next large X-ray mission on the books. The European Space Agency-led Athena X-ray observatory is expected to launch in 2028.

NASA partnered with Japan to launch the instrument on an X-ray observatory in 2000. ASTRO-E was to be the Japan's fifth X-ray astronomy mission, but was unfortunately lost during launch (10 Feb 2000). Astro-E was developed at the Japanese Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) in collaboration with the US and Japanese institutions.

Close-in planets around giant stars
------------------------------------------------------------
Close-in planets around giant stars: lessons from planet engulfment, by Dr. Jorge LILLO-BOX (ESO, Chile)
 
    Extrasolar planets abound in almost any possible configuration. However, until five years ago, there was a lack of planets orbiting closer than 0.5 au to giant or subgiant stars. Since then, recent detections have started to populate this regime by confirming 13 planetary systems. In this talk I will summarize the results of our recently accepted paper (Lillo-Box et al., 2016) on the properties of these planets in terms of their formation and evolution off the main sequence. Interestingly, we find that 70% of the planets in this regime are inner components of multiplanetary systems. This value is :math:`4.2\sigma` higher than for main-sequence hosts, which we find to be 42%. I will provide the possible interpretations of this observational difference and their implications in our knowledge of the processes of planet migration and planet engulfment.

Jorge started reviewing the history of exoplanets discoveries, starting in the 90's with the pulsar 51 Peg b, coming the the contemporary days where a planet smaller than Mercury was found (Kepler-37 b), reaching a total of ~2000 exoplanets discovered, including many in the habitable zone. This discoveries can be classified in three major groups: transit (light-curve), radial velocities and other techniques.

The theory of planet formation are basically two: models of "core accretion" and "gravitational instability". The point it that these two models do not explain the characteristics of the observed planets, specially the migration one would expect to describe the planets observed (e.g., migration is usually a fast process).

Until 2010 there was a desert of planets close to giant stars. Jorge worked with Kepler data, which may contain a lot of contamination because of its plate scale, of 4"x4" per pixel. During his PhD he found a planet around Kepler-91, so close that the star will wrap the planet when it expand in its later evolution, and that could make the star to become oblate. Another planet may be present in this star 3:1 (period) resonance, that will be confirmed by HARPS observations. Kepler-432 is another Giant star, with a hot-Jupiter and other planet in resonance. 

These are examples that the picture of exoplanets changed from 2010 to 2015, with a lack owing to observational bias. And the new picture points that these planets in massive stars weren't formed *in situ*, but maybe related to outwards-inwards movements, that occurred the in end of the main-sequence. They are usually in multiple systems.

There is a bias that make it hard to detect small planets around the giant stars; planets in main sequence are usually a single Jupiter, while in the giant planets there just are not there ("fall"). Close-in planets in giant stars are rare (they easily fall into the stars in the end of the MS); their survival must be related to pseudo-resonance effects, where the outer one could be anchoring the inner one.

Digging into the Milky Way past
------------------------------------------------
Digging into the Milky Way past: the formation of the Galactic Bulge, by Dr. Annalisa CALAMIDA (NOAO, USA)

    *Old low-mass stars are a fundamental tool for understanding stellar evolution and star formation in our Milky Way. Different evolutionary phases can be adopted to probe the chemo-dynamical properties of the oldest stellar populations in the Galaxy, while the last stage of low-mass stars, the white-dwarf cooling sequence, is a valuable tool for understanding the formation history of the Milky Way.
    In this talk I will present results on the characterization of the Galactic bulge stellar populations based on the study of different low-mass star evolutionary phases.
    The work is based on observations collected with the  Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope.
    Very accurate proper motions were measured and allowed me to separate disk and bulge stars and obtain a clean bulge color-magnitude diagram. I then identified for the first time a white-dwarf cooling sequence in the Galactic bulge. By using the same dataset, I also derived the initial mass function of the pure bulge component down to 0.15 Mo, finding that it can be fit with two power laws with a break at M ~ 0.55 Mo, the slope being steeper  (alpha ~ -2.40) for the higher masses, and shallower (alpha ~ -1.25) for the lower masses. The slope of the bulge initial mass function is similar to the slope of the mass function derived for the disk in the high-mass regime, but it is slightly steeper in the low-mass regime.*

Low-mass stars are important mainly by two reasons: they reveal the process of star evolution (ages) and star formation. 

It made use of HST/ACS instrument for surveys and appeared on HST press-release in December last year. Although she thinks the IMF down to ~0.1 Msun is the most important achievement, the majority of news articles focused on the white-dwarf cooling sequence found for the bulge.

Although the MW bulge shows appears to be a classical bulge (high Z, and stars older than 10 Gyr), it also shows evidence to have a 'pseudo-bulge' component (show at least two populations in Z and :math:`\vec{v}`). Examples: [Fe/H] distributions (2 or 3 peaks) and color-mag diagram (K vs J-K, with 2 clumps). Bulge contains 1/4 of the MW mass, and since it was formed first, could have a different IMF. 

With HST/ACS field image at Sagitarius, they performed photometry down to Vmag ~ 30. With this they can access stars to reconstruc the IMF until M < 0.15 Msun, identifying WDs as age indicators. The field of ACS has only 3'x3', but constains up to 2 million stars. Combining field observations from 9 years ago, they derive very accurate proper motions to the stars (<0.5 mas/yr at Vmag=28). Other goals of the survey is to look for long term variability, as microleasing. 

It's not easy to separate bulge and disk stars because there is an overlap in the proper motions. So they selected only stars with a very small proper motion, so losing ~30% of bulge stars. That was not an issue thanks to large number of stars.

The deep observations allowed to identify a number of WDs, stablishing a colling sequence for the bulge. They were individually inspected, and by their type (DA=Hydrogen present; DB=He-core, CO-core) it is possible to fit a cooling sequence. A significant amount of He-core WD have a binary origin, and they could not reproduce the number of red WDs. Also, they found a number of dwarf novae, with :math:`\Delta m < 3`.

To determine the IMF, they set a number of isochrones with different ingredients, being aware of the completeness of the sample because of non-faint detections. Main ingredients: binarity, differential reddening, metallicity and age (with spreads). Total around 10000.

There is no strong depence on age, but metalicity could change the mass values in 8%. Since there is not solid determination of binarity for the bulge, they use the rate of 50% (this is important when determining the IMF of low mass stars). 

They found a 2 slope fitting changing around M=0.5Msun, with high mass in agreement to Salpeter and lower with Kroupa & Chabrier. This results in a similar IMF as determined to the disk, reinforcing the importance of the pseudo-bulge component. 

It is the first time that IMF went down to 0.15 Msun, and new telescopes will be ableto extend this, as well as to this to the MCs and other nearby galaxies.

Mapping the Nuclear Outflow of the Milky Way
------------------------------------------------
Mapping the Nuclear Outflow of the Milky Way: The Kinematics and Spatial Extent of the Fermi Bubbles, Dr. Rongmon BORDOLOI (MIT, USA)

    *Recent observations of gamma rays together with microwaves and polarized radio waves, have detected giant lobes of plasma (Fermi Bubbles) extending above and below the Galactic plane of the Milky Way. These are possible signs of a Nuclear wind powered by either the central black hole or concentrated nuclear star-formation; but our understanding of their origin is hampered by a lack of kinematic information. I will report new observations from a systematic, absorption-line survey that maps the spatial and kinematic properties of the biconical nuclear outflow, using UV spectroscopy of AGN and halo stars lying close on the sky to the Galactic Center. The variation in absorption properties with Galactic latitude allows us to constrain the physical conditions in the outflowing gas. The observed kinematics of absorption components will be discussed and compared to predictions from biconical outflow models. I will show that the observed absorption profiles can be explained by a biconical nuclear wind with a radial velocity of ~ 1000 km/sec, and constrain the kinematic age of the Fermi Bubbles to be ∼6–9 Myrs. Using these estimates, I will constrain the minimum mass of UV absorbing gas entrained in the Fermi Bubbles. These observations illustrate the novel use of UV spectroscopy to constrain the feedback processes that regulate galaxy evolution.*

He presented nicely in ESO on May 2nd (nice slides, figures and clear explanations). The general context is that galactic outflows are important tracers of SFR, AGN activities, age of these events and can help constraining the chemical evolution.

The structure studied was the *Fermi bubble*, whose map was published in 2010 by Su+. It is the X-ray counterpart of the microwave emission structure seen in WMAP and following satellites. It was first thought as a signal of Dark-Matter annihilation, but ruled out by its asymmetric shape. It can also be seen in polarized radio emission (synchrotron, supporting the idea of a bubble of hot gas). The explanation scenarios where mainly two: or a fast AGN-like event or a secular local star formation that launched the material. Until now, only studies involving emission, with no kinematical information. 

The idea of the work was to study the line-absorption profiles in UV over background sources (AGNs), and calibrate them with halo (inside the bubble) and foreground stars (before the bubble). They used HST/COS spectra with resolution of a tens of km/s to see blue and red absorption bands in the line absorption profile. They analyzed the northern part because in the south there is a contamination by the Magellanic stream. 

With the proper projections and velocities to the (V_LSR) The derived kinematics of the bubble is consistent with a biconical wind outflow with velocities up to ~1000-1200 km/s. The absorption in seen in both blue and red shift at lower Galactic latitudes, then only in blue-shift, and then it disappear (in a equivalent height of 7 kpc). This kinematics points to a recent event (6-9 Myr), excluding the scenario of secular nuclear activity. 

Combining UV absorption spectra with UV lines it is possible to derive temperature, density and chemistry of the gas. The Hydrogen column density is log10 N_HI ~ 18.23 cm-2, and the metallicity ranges between 20-30% the solar one. 

With density and kinematics, it is possible to derive a outflow of 0.3-0.5 Msun/yr. Based on some arguments I did not catch about efficiency, the total mass implied inside the Fermi Bubble is ~5e6 Msun. Also, there were questions about the low metallicity of the Hubble (since it is a recent event).

The most mysterious star in the universe
-----------------------------------------
Something massive, with roughly 1,000 times the area of Earth, is blocking the light coming from a distant star known as KIC 8462852, and nobody is quite sure what it is. As astronomer Tabetha Boyajian investigated this perplexing celestial object, a colleague suggested something unusual: Could it be an alien-built megastructure? Such an extraordinary idea would require extraordinary evidence. In this talk, Boyajian gives us a look at how scientists search for and test hypotheses when faced with the unknown.

Radiative Driven Winds, main parameters are :math:`v_\infty` and :math:`\dot{M}`. The opacity of line transitions makes the particles (atoms) accelerate! 

.. math::

    g_L = g\exp(M(t)) \\
    M(t) = kt^{-\alpha}

:math:`(k, \alpha)` were first estimated by Abbott (1982) through the approximation of Sobolev (a Gaussian absorption profile can the considered as a "hat profile" until a given wavelength, close to :math:`\lambda_0`).

A more precise :math:`M(t)` was derived by Noebauer & Sim (2015), using a Monte-Carlo method to estimate :math:`(k, \alpha)`

.. math::

    M(t)=kt&^{-\alpha}\left( \frac{10*{N_e}}{W} \right)^\delta

where :math:`(k, \alpha)` corresponds to the *fast* component and the other term to the *slow* component. 

At Universidade de Valparaíso, they are using a Hydrodynamics Wind code to derive the radial velocity profile, with atomic information from H to Fe. His current work was presented at SOCHIA 2016 (Antofagasta).

Techniques of calculating :math:`v\sin i` (Part 2)
--------------------------------------------------------
Actually, there are three (four?) methods to determine the :math:`v\sin i`:
    
    1. From Fourier transform analysis;
    2. From Equivalent Width (EW) measurements
    3. From spectral synthesis.
    4. From the line FWHM

Method 1 relies on some assumptions of the influence of the "non-rotated" line profile and on the limb-darkening coefficients. The foundation of this method is described by Gray `(book) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992oasp.book.....G>`_.

Method 2 must be interesting, because the assumption that EW do not change with rotation is not true... Good reads are `Daflon+ (2007) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AJ....134.1570D>`_ and `Garmany+ (2015) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AJ....150...41G>`_.

Method 3 is the most easy to understand, but do not takes into account gravity darkening and oblateness (actually, none of these method does).

Variable stars!

Variable star is an amazing topic! Its complementary topic is the stellar pulsations, with p and g modes... But this is a subject of another topic.

GCVS is the General Catalog of Variable Stars

A Double Periodic Variable (DPV) is a rare an interesting type of binary star. These systems apparently lose mass cyclically into the interstellar medium. Catalogs of Double Periodic Variables are given by Mennickent, Otero and Kolaczkowski (2016), Pawlak et al. (2013) and Poleski et al. (2010).

Setting fundamental constants of physics and astronomy
--------------------------------------------------------
On physical constants, CODATA (Committee on Data for Science and Technology) release a list of values set in 2014, available here 
    http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07956

The NIST/CODATA index of constants can be accessed at
    http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/index.html

On astronomical constants, the IAU release a list of Solar-related constants in 2009 by Luzum+ (2011). However, Prsa & Harmanec (2012) suggested a number of improvements.
Particularly interesting is that the gravity constant :math:`G` still has a big uncertainty in its measurement. So, its recommended determining :math:`GM_*` instead of :math:`M_*` for the celestial bodies - specially exoplanets.

------

Techniques of calculating :math:`v\sin i`
-------------------------------------------
One way for determining the rotational speed of a star is to measure the broadening of its photospheric line profiles due to its rotation. The procedure would be:
1. Determining the resolution of the spectrum with the line profile.
2. Specify the line profile that star would have without rotation.
3. Describe how a line changes with a given rotation rate.
4. Calculate synthetic lines from (2) and (3) and compared with the observed one.

The website http://www.ster.kuleuven.be/~pieterd/python/html/core/scipy_fft.html show us how to do this with Python, in a procedure commonly used (e.g., `Dravins+, 1990 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990A%26A...237..137D>`_) through frequency analysis (FFT).

It must be noted that in this example (2) is assumed to be a Gaussian profile with **arbitrary width**. The right procedure is to have a line synthesized from an stellar atmospheric model. Also, the "broadening core" is based on an **arbitrary limb-darkening coefficient**...

The best procedure to this analysis? I'm still looking for...

The unexpected eccentricity of long period SdB binaries
---------------------------------------------------------
by Joris VOS (Universidad de Valparaiso, Chile)

    Hot subdwarf binaries are evolved core He burning stars with very thin hydrogen envelopes (<0.1 Msol). The only way to form these stars is through binary evolution, which makes then interesting objects to study binary evolution methods.
    Hot subdwarf-B stars in long period binaries are found to be on eccentric orbits, even though current binary evolution theory predicts these systems to circularise before the onset of Roche-lobe overflow.
    We aimed to find binary evolution mechanisms that can explain these eccentric long period orbits, and reproduce the currently observed period-eccentricity diagram. Three different processes are considered; tidally enhanced wind mass loss, phase dependent RLOF on eccentric orbits and the interaction between a circumbinary disk and the binary. To test these processes they were implemented in the binary module of the stellar evolution code MESA.
    We find that a combination of phase dependent mass loss and circumbinary disk interaction can explain the eccentricities of the observed systems, but the models are unable to reproduce the observed trend of higher eccentricities at longer orbital periods. Further observations in combination with theoretical modeling will hopefully solve this discrepancy.

Sub-dwarf B (sdB) are stars at the extreme blue side of the HRD, connecting the most luminous stars to the White dwarfs sequence. They are understood as He burning cores, with a "missing H envelope". M ~ 0.5 Msun, with Teff of 22000-40000 K. 

sdB binaries are long period binaries, understood as the result of a binary interaction: a Red Giant star donates its envelope to a Main Sequence (lower mass) star. The transfer can be as Unstable RLOF (Roche Lobe OverFlow), or a Stable RLOF (e.g., a disk. See Han+ 2003).

The point is: the mass transfer should circularize the orbit of of these systems. What is observed: for periods of until ~700 days, no eccentricity (*e*) is observed; then a linear relation existis between the period and *e*, where *e* = 0.2 corresponds to a period of 1300 days.

Mechanisms to introduce *e*: 
- Phase-dependent mass loss (Soker 2000; Bonacic+ 2008);
- Circumbinary disk, with Lindblad resonance (Dermine+ 2013; Artymowiz & Lubow 1994).

Applying the stellar evolution code MESA, the evolution of these systems were studied. The mass loss fraction were taken from Tauris+ (2006). For the disk, SPH simulations were performed, with :math:`R_{out}` fixed. It was found a possible connection to dusty post-RGB binaries (?).

White dwarfs
---------------
Beyond Sirius B, there is no white dwarf (WD) in the sky brighter than mV=12. As an example, Sirius B is one of the most luminous WD, with L~0.03 Lsun. Also, it is the closest one, at 8.61 ly (2.64 pc, absolute magnitude of 11.18).

Hubble Team Breaks Cosmic Distance Record (resolving a galaxy)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Hubble team announced the record of the farthest galaxy ever seen. Named GN-z11, this surprisingly bright, infant galaxy is seen as it was 13.4 billion years in the past. The astronomers saw it as it existed just 400 million years after the big bang. At a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of 11.1, the galaxy is even farther away than originally thought. It existed only 200 million to 300 million years after the time when scientists believe the very first stars started to form. At a billion solar masses, it is producing stars surprisingly quickly for such an early time. This new record will most likely stand until the launch of Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, which will look even deeper into the universe for early galaxies.

"We've taken a major step back in time, beyond what we'd ever expected to be able to do with Hubble." Before astronomers determined the distance for GN-z11, the most distant galaxy measured spectroscopically had a redshift of 8.68 (13.2 billion years in the past). GN-z11 is 25 times smaller than the Milky Way and has just one percent of our galaxy's mass in stars.However, it is growing fast, forming stars at a rate about 20 times greater than our galaxy does today.

J-PLUS is the photometric calibration to J-PAS (Javalambre Physics Accelerating universe Survey). J-PAS will be performed by a 2.5m telescope, with 3 deg x 3 deg FoV, with a total of 54 narrow filters. It will make use of 14 CCDs of 9k x 9k (81 Mpx).

J-PLUS is using a 80 cm telescope with 2 deg x 2 deg FoV; single 81 Mpx camera and scale-plate of 0.553"/px. It started operating in November 2015. The field of J-PLUS is much bigger than WFPC2 @HST, OSIRIS @GTC or WFC @INT!

The tools of J-PLUS/J-PAS are designed "à la SDSS", with the VO standards. MUFFIT is a SED fitting tool (Díaz García+ 2015); outreach info is available at http://cefca.es/outreach. 

The first call of proposals has alrady opened at http://oajweb.cefca.es/observingtime/description, with 10% reserved to Spanish researchers; 20% to proposasl and 70% to the survey. 

In 7 years is the big survey design and 2/3 years, a short survey release.

ESO TMT: A pragmatic Bayesian perspective on correlation analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pedro FIGUEIRA, University of Porto. 

    Very often we want to assess the if there is a correlation between two quantities. This is often done in the frequentist framework, using p-value analysis; unfortunately, it has been demonstrated that there are some fundamental flaws behind this kind of null hypothesis testing procedure. We consider the alternative approach of applying the Bayesian framework. To do so, we estimate the probability distribution of the parameter of interest, $\rho$, characterizing the strength of the correlation. We provide an implementation of these ideas and concepts using python programming language and the pyMC module in a very short (~130 lines of code, heavily commented) and user-friendly program. We used this tool to assess the presence and properties of the correlation between planetary surface gravity and stellar activity level as measured by the log(R'_HK) indicator. The results of the Bayesian analysis are qualitatively similar to those obtained via p-value analysis, and support the presence of a correlation in the data. The results are more robust in their derivation and more informative, revealing interesting features such as asymmetric posterior distributions or markedly different credible intervals, and allowing for a deeper exploration. We encourage those interested in this kind of problem to apply our code to his/her own scientific problems. The full understanding of what the Bayesian framework is can only be gained through the insight that comes by handling priors, assessing the convergence of Monte Carlo runs, and a multitude of other practical problems. We hope to contribute so that Bayesian analysis becomes a tool in the toolkit of researchers, and they understand by experience its advantages and limitations.

This definition is solidly based on the "copyrights" way of thinking. But I have my reservations about it. I will discuss this latter...

Just an example: I just typed "syllabus" on Google, a work in the vocabulary topic of the blog, and it returned 2 definitions, word origin and mentions over time. Source? Not easily accessible... Plagiarism? I never heard that Google did linguistics research...

VLTI max resolutions
---------------------
Appling :math:`\theta=1.22\lambda/D` (rad), one have (for 100 m baselines):

- J-band (1.25 um): 0.0032 arcsec
- H-band (1.65 um): 0.0042 arcsec
- K-band (2.20 um): 0.0056 arcsec

What is the physical diameter of a Be star with 10 R* as disk radius, with equatorial radius of 10 Rsun at 100 pc?

1 AU at 1 pc is 1 arcsec. The diameter of the system is 200 Rsun, or 0.93 AU (1 AU is ~215 Rsun). So, the system diameter would be 0.0093 arcsec. So VLTI can "resolve" it!

CHARA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For 300 m baselines. PAVO limits:

- 630 nm: 0.00053 arcsec
- 900 nm: 0.00076 arcsec

Other:

- J-band (1.25 um): 0.0011 arcsec

CLASSIC/MIRC/CLIMB bands:

- H-band (1.65 um): 0.0014 arcsec
- K-band (2.20 um): 0.0019 arcsec

Vega (equatorial) size is 2.8 Rsun. Its distance is 7.68 pc, resulting in a diameter of 0.0034 arcsec. So it can be easily resolved by PAVO.

NASA Introduces New, Wider Set of Eyes on the Universe: WFIRST
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST). WFIRST will image large regions of the sky in near-infrared light to answer fundamental questions about dark energy and the structure and evolution of the universe. WFIRST will have a mirror the same size as Hubble's, but it will have a 100 times wider view of space. Slated for launch in the mid-2020s, it will complement the capabilities of NASA's other major astrophysical observatories. 

WFIRST will carry a wide-field instrument for surveys, and a coronagraph instrument designed to block the glare of individual stars and reveal the faint light of planets orbiting around them. By blocking the light of the host star, the coronagraph instrument will enable detailed measurements of the chemical makeup of planetary atmospheres.

NASA asked for an ESA participation at the WFIRST mission. I'm curious to know how it is different from James Webb, of course beyond having an extended FoV... As I understood, its financial costs is not yet guaranteed.

Hubble Directly Measures Rotation of Cloudy 'Super-Jupiter'
------------------------------------------------------------
THe number of exoplanets is currently roughly 2000 (http://exoplanets.org, http://exoplanet.eu). Hubble Telescope detected the emission of the a giant planet (4 Jupiter mass) 170 light-years from Earth, orbiting a faint brown dwarf (2M1207). The dwarf is so dim and far from the planet that astronomers were able to isolate the planet's glow.

The investigators found a periodic flickering as the planet spins on its axis, interpreted as the movement of the clouds on its atmosphere. "These measurements have led to an estimate of how fast the planet is spinning through direct observation", a first for an exoplanet.

Short abstract: stellar mergers could be the origin of the (strong) magnetic field in massive stars.

Selected parts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
~10% of the massive stars have magnetic field, while only ~2% of those are in binary systems.

The B[e] supergiant in the wide binary system R4 (P orb ~ 21 yr) in the Small Magellanic Cloud is suggested to be a merger product and is surrounded by a young (1.2 x 10^4 yr), nitrogen-enriched, bipolar nebula expanding with a velocity of about 100 km s-1 (Pasquali et al. 2000).

Critics
^^^^^^^^
It is hard to have precise age of the stars and the cluster to infer differences.

The article do not discuss if the fact that the presence of the magnetic field in the star could itself make the star appears younger due to its enhanced mixing.

The discovery of a supernova type Ia progenitor at the heart of a planetary nebula
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Jones (Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias)

    I will present the discovery of a super-Chandrasekhar double-degenerate binary system at the heart of the planetary nebula Hen 2-428.  Planetary nebulae (PNe) represent the final stage in the evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars, forming from the mass ejected by the star during its AGB evolution before being ionised by the star's, now exposed, core.  As binarity is expected to play a key role in the formation of aspherical PN morphologies, we have been intensively searching for new binary central stars in a push towards a statistical sample.  One of our newly-discovered binary systems had a further surprise to reveal, with observations and modelling showing the system to consist of twin evolved stars with a total mass greater than the Chandrasekhar limit.  The short period of the system, only 4.2 hours, means that the two stars will merge together in approximately 700 Myr, resulting in a Supernova Type Ia.  While the super-Chandrasekhar merger of two white dwarfs has long been considered a formation pathway for SN Ia, this is the first system found that is confirmed to be both massive enough and in a tight enough orbit to merge in less than a Hubble time.

Wolf-Rayet stars as the key for understanding massive stars
------------------------------------------------------------
Wolf-Rainer HAMANN (University of Potsdam)

    Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are characterized by bright and broad emission lines in their optical spectra. Those lines give evidence for strong stellar winds. The quantitative analysis of such spectra requires adequate non-LTE model atmospheres, which account for the absence of local thermodynamical equilibrium and the atmospheric expansion. State-of-the-art model atmospheres, such as the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) code, can reproduce the observed WR spectra sufficiently and thus allow their reliable analysis. The results confirm that WR atmospheres are composed mainly by helium and nitrogen (WN types) and by helium, carbon and oxygen (WC and WO subtypes). A subgroup of WN stars also contain more or less hydrogen, while all other WR stars are hydrogen free. Models for the evolution of WR stars thus have to explain how the hydrogen-rich envelope has been lost. The WR populations of the Milky Way, the Magellanic Clouds, and some other nearby galaxies have been analysed comprehensively. The comparison with stellar evolution tracks reveals yet poor agreement, and demonstrates a strong dependence on the metallicity of the respective population. Interesting questions refer to the physics of the mass loss. As for other hot stars, radiation pressure is probably the main driving force. Such stellar winds are obviously inhomogeneous, which implies questions on the precision of empirical mass-loss rates, and is also relevent for the unsettled problem how such stars generate their X-ray emission. The feedback of hot massive stars by their ionizing radiation and wind has a strong impact on their environment, creating circumstellar nebulae and driving the evolution of their parental clusters. 

Wolf & Rayet were French astronomers that in 1867 detected broad emission lines in some stars (FWHM :math:`\Delta\lambda=24\AA` ~1500 km/s in HeII 4686 :math:`\AA`).

The "missing water" mistery in exoplanets
--------------------------------------------
http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/44/

A survey of 10 hot, Jupiter-sized exoplanets conducted with NASA's Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes has led a team to solve a long-standing mystery -- why some of these worlds seem to have less water than expected. The telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 is capable of detecting water vapor in such exoplanets - but at least half of them had no signal of water.

This study analyzed only **transit** exoplanets. Observing these passages, the difference in planetary radius as measured between visible and infrared wavelengths was used to indicate the type of planetary atmosphere being observed for each planet in the sample, whether hazy or clear. A cloudy planet will appear larger in visible light than at infrared wavelengths, which penetrate deeper into the atmosphere. 

"Our results suggest it's simply clouds hiding the water from prying eyes, and therefore rule out dry hot Jupiters," explained co-author Jonathan Fortney of the University of California, Santa Cruz. "The alternative theory to this is that planets form in an environment deprived of water, but this would require us to completely rethink our current theories of how planets are born."

Compositional diversity of main belt asteroids
-------------------------------------------------
Asteroids are classified according to the reflectance spectrum (De Meo+ 2009).

Asteroids with meteoritic analogues = spectrum comparison:
    - 1/3 mass of belt = metallic, rocky and hydrated (x-OH)
    -  2/3 mass of belt = low-density, icy asteroids (C-, P- and D-types)

These 2/3 types are unsampled in our terrestrial meteorite collections. Why? volative-rich components = comet-like activity.

Evidence: icy bodies are compatible with compatible with anhydrous (without water) interplanetary dust particles (IDPs).

Themis (a collisional asteroid) family: outer portions of the asteroid belt. One of the more populous families.

Mystery of "Born again" stars
-------------------------------
http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/star-cluster/2015/43/

Some stars weren't evolving as predicted: `Blue-stragglers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_straggler>`_ are hotter and bluer than they should for their advanced age, appearing to be "reinvigorated". 

Theory: an aging star spills material onto a smaller companion star. The small star bulks up, and become hotter and bluer. The aging star (the donor) collapses to a white dwarf. 

NGC 188 has 21 blue-stragglers (BS): Hubble detected 7 WD companions and in other 7 there is evidence of mass-transfer events.

So ~2/3 of the BS in NGC 188 formed through mass transfer. This is the 1st fraction estimative of BS. BS represent ~25% of evolved stars.

Stellar associations and the different age scales: How far can we go?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Barrado (Center of Astrobiology, INTA-CSIC) 

    A significant fraction of what we know about stellar properties depend on stellar associations, since they are open windows to understand stellar evolution. Specifically, they allow us to understand the change with time and mass. Thus, they are our laboratories where different theories can be tested. However, age is a key parameter and its estimation is not an easy task. A overview of the different methodologies will be presented, focusing on open clusters, moving groups and star forming regions, and their validity and limits will be discussed.

Main idea: different set of models leads to different answers.

Only two absolute anchors: 
    - (i) Big Bang 13.799(21) Gyr; 
    - (ii) Solar System (Sun & asteroids) 4.57 Gyr; 
    - (Nothing at Myr age scale!!)

LDB: Lithium Depletion Boundary - is a method proposed for dating open clusters based on a determination of the lithium abundances of a cluster's stars whose masses are at about the hydrogen burning mass limit.

Problem: Gaia was blind to very young star associations.

Siz techs to determining ages (Mermilhod 2000):
    - turn-off
    - morphological
    - isochrone
    - ...(?)

Methods for Globular clusters:
    - LF (luminosity function; age and distance)
    - WD cooling time
    - Asterosismology (Moya+ 2010)
    - Power spectrum of the light-curve (Lillo-Box+ 2014)

Cornerstone: Pleiades (David+ 2015)
    - LDB in Pleiades: Stauffer+ (1009)
    - CMD: Colour-Mag Diagram = 15 < age < 450 Myr
    - Interferometry: Jones+ (2015)
    - Gyrochronology: Barnes (2007); Mamajek & Hillenbrand (2008)

Intro do (M)HD codes, Luis Kadowaki @ GAi, day 16
-------------------------------------------------------
Soluções: N-corpos, ou dinâmica de fluidos (como SPH), estes em geral escritos em termos das equações de Euller.

Critérios para ser um fluido:
    - Livre caminho médio pequeno no sistema
    - Tempo entre colisões >> Tempo de evolução
    - Distância média entre colisões << que o tamanho característico do sistema

Como regra, há 6 variáveis e 6 equações a serem resolvidas (7, no caso MHD): 3 momentos, :math:`\rho`, Pressão (Eq. de estado) e Energia.

Métodos: diferenças finitas (funções como "trapézios"). *FTCS: Forward Time, Centered Space*. As equações diferenciais de ordem superior a 1 podem ser classificadas em (i) elípticas, (ii) parabólicas, (iii) hiperbólicas. A eq. de onda (e outras) não Hiperbólicas, e por isso não funcionam no FTCS!

Método de Lax-Friedrichs: funciona para eqs. hiperbólicas. Mas sistema deve satisfazer o critério CFL (Courent-Friedrichs-Levy) para garantir a estabilidade das soluções.

Nos problemas HD, a propagação das condições dá-se pela velocidade do som no meio. Nos problemas MHD, pela velocidade de Alfvén.

*General solution strategy*: (1) discretizar o domínio, (2) definir as condições iniciais, (3) determinar o :math:`\Delta t` permitido pelo CFL, (4) calcular *fluxos*; ... de maneira iterativa.

Método Godunov (ou de Volume Finito): usa a forma integral das equações. Com isso, assume valores **médios** para o interior das células. Mas a solução necessita de valores de fluxos nas **interfaces** das células. Isso pode introduzir **discontinuidades** na resolução, problema conhecido por *Problema de Riemann*. 

Há vários métodos para a solução do problema de Rieman: roc, HLL, HLLC, ... Em geral, usa-se um esquema de reconstrução de 2a ordem para ser usado junto com o método de Riemann, que podem não ser monotônicos (método de mínimo slope). 

Inicialmente resolve-se as variáveis primitivas :math:`v, P` e depois as substitui nas variáveis conservativas :math:`mv, E`...
A estratégia em Godunov é utilizar *sub-time steps* nos cômputos.

Apresentação Laerte
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

3 itens importantes: (i) Atualidade, (ii) Importância Institucional e (iii) Visibilidade.
Presença de big data nos 3 departamentos do IAG. Desafios: armazenamento, transferência e processamento.

Muitos post-docs estão arrumando empregos em ciência de dados. Exemplo Nature: PhD da Inglaterra trabalha com desenvolvimento de algoritmos para clientes escolherem suas roupas. 

Exemplo Astro: SDSS. Bilhôes de objetos, desde Sist.Solar à extra-gal.

Importância para o Instituto: 3 deptos. não interagem entre si. Big-data pode ser a ponta que falta para solidificar; Algoritmos e machine-learning para todos.

Pela 1a. vez IAG se reune para discutir problemas históricos.

Dificuldade de recursos humanos = institutos como o IAG não podem contratar especialistas em computação. Necessidade de instituto transversais.

IME tem suporte para desenvolvimento de software livre.

Falta à universidade e ao Brasil uma programa de produção científica. Hoje os esforços são iniciativas individuais.

Dark Matter review, ? @ Univ. Toledo, day 04
---------------------------------------------
1930's = Zwicky. "Problem": (1) theory of gravity; (2) assumptions; (3) additional mass.

"Non-virial" condition: :math:`\frac{GM_*}{R^2}\ll \frac{v^2}{R}`.

1970's M51 (Robin). 

1980's Cold Dark Matter model (Peebles): model designed for **simplicity**, not realism.
Cold; non-interacting (or weak-scale); Gaussian, adiabatic initial fluctuation (only gravity).

"It must be wrong!": made to explain galaxies :math:`\rightarrow` whole universe. 
Successfully described the creation of structures in the universe.

Precise tests of gravity: 
    - CMB = structures formation (large structure). 
    - Solar system dynamics = 13 decimal places of accuracy!
    - Lab. tests.

DM options:
    - WIMPs = Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (the only strongly motivated model from particle theory)
    - Axions or other particle exotica
    - Tiny black holes
    - ...

Zeinab @ OCA, day 18
----------------------
R136 cluster = "star burst"

SPHERE instrument = 10-50 mas; 1.0-2.0 :math:`\mu m`.

AO = Shack Hartmann wave front sensor

Star cluster formation: almost all stars are born in clustered mode:
    #. collapse of molecular clouds
    #. formation in filaments and radiatively out the residual gas
    #. dynamical evolution of the newly formed star cluster

Important *ingredients*:
    - mass segregation
    - infant mortality
    - IMF
    - binary fraction

Relation between most massive star and the total cluster mass (Weidner & Kroupa).

Low/High Mass X-ray binaries, Atsuo Okazaki @ IAG
-------------------------------------------------------
X-ray binaries are composed of a star and and compact star.

Low mass (:math:`<1M_\odot`, LMXB) stars usually at galactic bulge (old stars).

High mass (:math:`>10M_\odot`, HMXB) stars are the young population (galactic disk).

Roche lobe overflow: donor gives matter and forms an accretion disk ("low magnetic field NS").

LMXB are very close binaries (e.g., a neutron star as compact star, with P_orb of 5-6 hours).

HMXB have (i) Be stars as donor ("high magnetic field or Black Hole") or (ii) Supergiants (stellar wind or Roche-lobe overflow). Supergiants that have a strong winds, the accretion occurs as the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion.

- HMXB Type I (normal outbursts): mass transfer from truncated Be disk at periastron.
- HMXB Type II (giant outbursts): transfer from warped Be disk?

X-ray binaries with emission > 100 GeV (TeV order): Pulsar Wind (PW) model vs MicroQuasar (MQ) model; emission < 100 GeV: Be binaries.
