Writing tips
==============
- Scientists publish IDEAS. Keep that in mind.

- People love *stories*. This could be a good way of writing a motivational letter, for example.

- Avoid:
    - "modern": In most of cases you are trying to say "contemporary". 
    - "due to": In most of cases you are trying to say "owing to" ("due to" has the sense of "attributable to")
    - "despite": In most of cases you are trying to say "although".

- Avoid qualitative expressions like "it is very important". Write HOW it is important.


Useful expressions
-------------------
- *Building on results* = aprofundamento de resultados, aprofundamento de resultados
    Building on results from the project, this study shows...

- It provides a useful organization of both observational signatures and theoretical predictions. 

- This paper aims to provide an initial classification of the observed properties...

- These goals are being achieved through large observing allocations at the X telescope.

- Although we consider..., two noteworthy objects require a brief mention. 

- We present results from the photometric monitoring of ...

- ... it is well short of the level required for the significant episodes to occur. 

- In this paper we argue that...

- The present paper develops a new model for this feature...

- I am **in** a unique position.

- I'm on a trip.

- For what it's worth (FWIW): considering what limited worth this advice, opinion, or suggestion might have for you; Used to soften the presentation of unsolicited advice or information that may not be relevant (it may be useful information, it may not be, or perhaps differs in opinion from that of the recipients).

- It is about the same age as they are.


Definitions
===============
- **Theorem** is a (mathematical) statement that is proved using rigorous mathematical reasoning. Is usually reserved for the most important results or those with long or difficult proofs. A **proposition** is a *theorem* of no particular importance (a statement with a simple proof).

- A **lemma** is a "helping theorem", a proposition with little applicability except that it forms part of the proof of a larger theorem. 

- An **axiom** or **postulate** is a statement that is accepted without proof and regarded as fundamental to a subject. Historically, *axiom* was regarded as "self-evident", but nowadays they are used to describe the assumptions of the subject of study.

- A **definition** is also accepted without proof since it simply gives the meaning of a word or phrase in terms of known concepts.

- An unproven statement that is believed true is called a **conjecture** (or sometimes a **hypothesis**).

- A **corollary** is a proposition that follows with little proof from another *theorem* or *definition*. Also a *corollary* is used for a *theorem* restated for a more restricted special case. A **generalization** is a *theorem* which includes a previously proven *theorem* as a special case and hence as a *corollary*.

- A **rule** is a *theorem* that establishes a useful formula.

- An **algorithm** is a procedure or formula for solving a problem.

- An **identity** is an equality between two mathematical expressions.

- A **law** or a **principle** is a theorem that applies in a wide range of circumstances.

- A **paradox** is a statement that can be shown to be both true and false.
