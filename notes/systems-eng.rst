Elcano Instrumentation Lab

About the group: Why "Elcano"?
==============================
Ferdinand Magellan's expedition in 1522 was the first to circumnavigate the earth, completing one of the most ambitious feats of exploration at the time. However, such enterprise proved costly: during the passage through the Pacific,  Magellan died on April 1521. The last third of journey had the command of Juan Sebastian Elcano.

This instrumentation group emerged to join FAPESP efforts as partner of the GMT (Giant Magellan Telescope) project. So, nothing better than honoring the second person behind this great achievement that was the circumnavigation, and that gives name to the project.
